## I think Components, GameObjects, and Scenes like a theater.
Components are the skills and traits of each actor. For example, one actor might know how to dance, another how to speak lines, and another how to sing.  GameObjects are the actors themselves. Some are young boys, some are old women, some are beautiful ladies. Each one has different talents and appearance that define what they can act. Scenes are the stages where the play happens. The setting that brings all the actors together to perform and interact.
Without Components, the actors can¡¯t perform; without GameObjects, there are no actors; and without Scenes, there¡¯s no place for the story to act. All three work together like a live performance: actors (GameObjects) use their abilities (Components) to act, and all of these happened on the stage (Scene), creating the good performance for the audiences and also game players.
